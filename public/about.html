<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up in Michigan and went to both University of Michigan and Michigan State. After graduation, I got a job
  that took me to New York City. While there, I went to so many restaurants that I can't even remember. The pizza
  was phenomenal there though. Something about the water. 99 cent pizza is and always will be my favorite.</p>

<p>I met my husband while I was there and he lived in DC. Eventually, I moved down to DC, keeping my same job. We both
  worked opposite schedules unfortunately, so we never really saw each other. We did get a dog though, which made us happy.

<p>Finally, my husband got a job offer that was only in San Diego. It's funny because he asked for New York, DC, and Michigan
  but only got the west coast as an option. We love it here and moved my dad out to live with us as well. He also
  loves San Diego. And the public transportation here.
